# 2-week-timetable-IFTTT
> A timetable for my school life made with python that sends a notification to my phone using IFTTT and requests.

This was a quick project made in under an hour for me to learn more about requests and try IFTTT, I will improve the code and perhaps make it change my devices wallpaper for the day... but only later :)
